# Instructor Resources

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository is for instructor resources, either for startup and training or for developing skills, expanding your own knowledge or expanding the knowledge of your students.  The purpose of these resources is not to make it so you don't have to get people to work on their process but to give you something to start with, something to add to and something to build upon.

#### <a name="metacog"></a> Metacognition

[Some Definitive Information](https://www.edutopia.org/blog/metacognition-gift-that-keeps-giving-donna-wilson-marcus-conyers)

**A few basic principles:**
1. Explicitly teach students about this essential learning skill by defining the term metacognition. Especially with younger students, we recommend a metaphor -- such as driving their brains -- as a concrete way to guide them toward thinking about how they can best learn. This metaphor taps into students' desires to master important skills for driving their destiny.

2. Ask students to describe the benefits and supply examples of driving their brains well. For example, sometimes we might need to put on the brakes (e.g., by reviewing a reading passage to make sure that we understand it) or step on the gas (e.g., by jotting down and organizing notes for an essay instead of getting stuck on how to start it). We need to keep our brains moving in the correct lane and along best route toward achieving our goals.

3. Whenever possible, let students choose what they want to read and topics they want to learn more about. When they are genuinely interested and motivated to learn about a topic of study, students are apt to sustain interest in thinking about a project over the long haul.

4. Look for opportunities to discuss and apply metacognition across core subjects and in a variety of lessons so that students can transfer it for the most benefit. When Donna has taught this topic, she's often asked students to give examples across academics, in interactions with friends and family, and (for older students) on the job. If she's with young children, she asks them how their parents might use this strategy in their work.

5. Model metacognition by talking through problems. We've found that students learn a lot from listening as their teachers use higher-order thinking strategies aloud. They often laugh when their teachers make "mistakes," and they learn when their teachers stop, recognize the miscue, and step through the process of correcting. This "teachable moment" underscores that everyone makes mistakes, and that mistakes are best seen as opportunities to learn and improve.

#### <a name="thoughts-on-teaching"></a> Thoughts on the teaching process
<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The focus of the teacher should be to create a safe environment. One that allows the students to take over, not in a [_Lord Of The Flies_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_of_the_Flies) kind of way, more in the spirit of [Burning Man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man) and [radical inclusion](https://burningman.org/culture/philosophical-center/10-principles/). This process of creating a space that is safe, open and accepting is meant to empower, to encourage the students to define from within why the wish to be, why they wish to focus on one state of being over another.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For this to work fluidly there has to be some level of chaos, with a concrete syllabus or curriculum the information becomes stale quickly, but with a living classroom, one that defines itself from within and conversely lets the students define themselves from within the environment is made and protected by those that make it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are same downsides of course. The most obvious being fear and confusion. This is especially relevant during the initial  and during the terminal stages when the students feel they are leaving the space and re-entering a world that still defines itself in terms of the robust, hierarchical and didactic.
