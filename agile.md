There is a lot of depth you could go into here, but at very least there is the [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development)) board

It follows a general guiding principle:

| Backlog | On-deck | Current Sprint | QA | Complete |
| :---    |  :---:   |     :---:     | :---: | ---:   |
|  Required | Optional | Required | Optional  | Required   |
| Cards in this    | Cards in this | Cards in this | Cards in this | Cards in this |
| column represent | column represent | column represent | column represent | column represent |
| Packaged tasks from | Ready to start | Working on tasks | Tasks that are | Tasks that are |
| start to finish | tasks | currently assigned | ready to test | completed |

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can vary this system quite a bit but the basic idea is to modularize tasks and to communicate an overall sense of accomplishment that belies the underlying complexity of the entire project.
