# Open Space

[Wikipedia Info](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Space_Technology)

There are a few basics tenants that go into open space, they are discussed more in depth in the article above, a quick synopsis:

The Circle is the main stage, all events happen within it in some way.  It starts the process and if you have a cool little meditation bell you can use that too.  You will need painters tape, post-its, paper to write on and sharpies/markers.

You can denote time slots on the wall somehow, with tape and a grid is usually the best way, time blocks depend on the context, but 15 mins seems to work fairly well.

People gather in the circle using the fireplace/storytelling format to express ideas, a person steps up, writes their idea down with their name and then announces inside the circle their idea and picks a time slot.

After there is a general lull in idea generation there is a marketplace segment, where people can trade time slots if they would like to go to several events at the same time.  Then people begin to mull around and talk using these general principles:


The guiding principles:
1. Whoever comes is the right people
2. Whenever it starts is the right time
3. Wherever it is, is the right place
4. Whatever happens is the only thing that could have
5. When it's over it's over, within a session...
6. Above all, prepare to be surprised.

The Law of Two Feet
If at any time during our time together you find yourself in any situation where you are neither learning nor contributing, use your two feet, go someplace else.
