# Tips for Part-time Class Weeks

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is the schedule that we began to fall into during the Summer 2016 part-time cohort. In no way are these firm guidelines, and I'd definitely encourage listening to the students over listening to us.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the biggest issues that students have early on is coping with a lack of structure. Some students are better equipped for that, so listen to them and ask them what they think of the class structure during the weekly retrospectives.

## Weekend

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the concepts you are introducing have many steps or are very difficult for some students, it has been helpful to create a short video. In general, long videos work fine, usually between 30 minutes to 2 hours. It doesn't have to be polished or refined, and especially earlier on, it helps students defeat the myth that you know everything. Let them see your mistakes and your backtracking.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don't have a video you can just say: go checkout JQuery or JavaScript give them some MDN links.  I actually prefer this method, it encourages the RTFM way of approaching a problem and gets away from hand holding, but in the beginning there is a lot of fear and you need to guide them very specifically and with a lot of flashpoints.


## Tuesday
**6:00-6:15** **check in**, time is variable but 15 mins seems to work well

**6:15-6:30** **improv game**, there are some good resources for this we could demo a few just to get you started.  It's easier if you have someone to back you up in the beginning, espc. with some groups. Be sure to explain to the students *why* this improv is useful, and how it might apply to their learning.

**6:30-7:00** **JavaScript exercises**, the daily repo isn't necessary, I actually prefer [exercism.io](http://exercism.io/), they are tested in about 30 languages with a nice CLI.  Either way these should focus on fundamentals with a decently steep learning curve,

**7:00-9:00** This tends to be pretty open and depending on the class you are working with you can parse this time differently, this of course also goes for the rest of the schedule but this part in particular we ran with two general concepts:

1. Review video and possibly code along,
  1. walk through code that was in video
  2. address any questions that came up through the process
  3. mob the process to finish a small project, pushed to git

2. From the referenced material mob in 3 and up
  1. time limit is key, setting 5 mins this goes for the JS exercises as well.
  2. build from the ground up, some project p5 was good for this because you could focus on a simple project and expand the modularity in the artistic frame

## Thursday

**6:00-6:30** Straight into Javascript exercises, mobbed

**6:30-8:30** Continue project and pushing up code

**8:30-9:00** Retro, this can be compressed a bit later
