`eaw-8-21-2017` - _Things we could have improved upon_

1. **Github early** - create some simple markdown exercise that forces groups to make many pushes, pulls and hopefully conflicts.  Let them break the system, a general concept is one of fragility, and facing that fear after you’ve spent 5 hours working on a routing and database system is no good.  They needed some simple exercises to move past the immobility of a git push and understand the VCS environment.

2. **Whiteboard sooner** - There was and probably is going to be a lot of emphasis on pair programming, mob programming, which is great for cooperation and learning, but does not give the teacher and more importantly the student a feeling of where they stand on their own, without a computer without a group.  <br/><br/>
Whiteboarding is in many ways artificial, but it isolates the student and moves them towards the realization that coding is not about memorizing massive lists of reference material, but organizing data and your thoughts about that data to create something.  It also sets the student up to share their process, and delivers some level of context for the teacher.

3. **Keep the check-ins and improv alive** - We moved away from the this kinda early, we kept the checkins alive and the retros but we paired them down a bit, I think this created a bit of stoicism in the group that is hurting us a bit farther down the line…
