Montana Code School Pre-Work Assignment

Exercise#1
Here is an assignment to give you some guidance in the prework to help you check how effectively you're learning.

This is to check understanding of some core aspects of programming that will be necessary to understand from the first day of code school in order to make sure that everyone can come in ready to start moving fast from day one. Complete part one at least one week before code school and send your answers to one of the code school instructors before moving on to part 2.

It is important that you complete part 2 before code school starts. If you find completing this difficult, it may mean that you would benefit from more time preparing to get ready to get the most out of a code school experience. Please reach out to your instructor to get help.

Part 1

First, be able to answer the following questions:

1.  Look at the following code

```
const firstName = "Toby";

function greet(name){
	return "Hello, " + name
}

console.log(greet(firstName))
```

Answer the following questions
a. What does this code do?
b. Why does line 11 use the variable "name" instead of firstName?

2. For the following code that prints out all the whole numbers between 0 and some other number

```
function countUp(num){
	var i=0;
	while(i <= num){
		console.log(i)
		i = i + 1
	}
}
```
a. How do you make this start at 1 instead of zero.
b. How would you make this count to twice the provided number.
c. How would you make this count by even numbers (2,4,6....).
d. How would you make this count down to zero instead of up. (3, 2,1, 0)

3. The next question there are many right answers. Using the basic functions you've learned in the prework write down some basic things you could use JavaScript for. For example, you could write a function that could take a string and capitalize the first letter after any period. You could write a function to determine if a number is prime. Create a list of about 10 things. At least 5 of them should use a loop of some sort if you were to implement them (a loop would be something with a for or a while).

Part 2

Choose one of the things from question 3 and implement it. It should use a loop and should involve applying functions. Before you start, ask one of the code school instructors on slack if what you've chosen to do is appropriate. After you've finished, show your answer to one of the code school instructors on slack to make sure that it meets the criteria.
